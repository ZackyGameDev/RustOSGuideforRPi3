# RustOSGuideforRPi3
This is a chapter wise beginner friendly guide to creating an Operating System for the Raspberry Pi 3 board, from scratch. This is written by me as I work on my own OS in the same condition. It serves as both as an educational guide and also a documentation of how I myself made my own OS. Naturally this means it is possible that as I discover more information, I may have to heavily amend previous writings. But still, I think it will be greatly beneficial to beginners who don't know anything.
