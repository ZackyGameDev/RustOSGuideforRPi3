# Introduction

Creating an Operating System from scratch is widely considered to be one of the most challenging tasks in computer science. It involves getting to know your machine at a hardware chip level, and getting acquianted with features and quirks that you never would have to worry about at software level. However it is still an attractive challenge because creating an Operating System can reward you with knowledge and insights of Computer Science at a personal level. Regardless whether you're doing this out of passion, out of need, or just because you're curious about how this all works. The point of this guide is to walk you through all the concepts involved from a beginner stage. This chapter will involve all the knowledge you need to have before you can write your first line of code.

# Where I come from

I am not a professional Operating Systems Engineer, nor am I a professor with lots of knowledge in this field. I just happen to be working on my own OS and I think I could do a helpful job of documenting the entire process. Naturally this means if I learn new things, I may edit chapters to add things to them or fix them. I can't promise that writing this guide will remain my top priority. However, I intend to fully follow through with it alongside my OS development.

# Targetted Hardware

This guide will specifically tailor to the Raspberry Pi 3 board. I myself used the RPi3b+ for my project, but everything should work for all interations of RPi3.
